        To the love of my life,<br /><br />
        It’s impossible to express in words how much you mean to me in this
        life, my heart skips a beat every time you appear in my mind. It feels
        like I’m falling in love for the first time whenever I see you, and the
        happiness starts flowing in my system when I think about a future with
        you.
        <br />
        Sometimes thinking about the future scares me a little, because I don’t
        be to way from you, and I want to be there for you all the time. But,
        even though that’s scary I’m not afraid, because the love I feel for you
        is stronger than anything existing in this multiverse.
        <br />

        I would have never imagined that love could feel this way, there are so
        many other things I want to write, but I cannot find the proper words to
        do so. I'm so thankful that you have chosen me to be your partner, and I
        will try my best to make you the happiest person of the entire world.
        <br />

        Happy 21st, and happy 5 months.
        
  
        I love you forever
        <br />
  
        Your Sol
